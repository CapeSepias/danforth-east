  Dear {{ member_first_name }},
</p>
<p>
  It's that time of year again… time to renew your membership with the Danforth East Community Association! DECA’s membership is a pay-what-you-can fee. We recommend a $20 donation for families but welcome everyone who works or lives in our community and wants to support DECA’s efforts to build a strong, vibrant and safe neighbourhood to join. Your membership support helps put on some amazing activities in our community, including the East Lynn Park Farmers’ Market, the Danforth East Arts Fair, the East Lynn Park Pumpkin Parade, the Danforth East Yard Sale, the Holiday Lighting Festival, and much more.
</p>
<p>
  To renew your membership, simply go to the Membership page on the DECA website and fill in the <a href="https://deca.to/membership/">registration form</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you again for supporting our community!
</p>
